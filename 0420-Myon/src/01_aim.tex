\section{Aim of the experiment}

In the experiment a component of cosmic radiation is investigated:
Muons which are produced in the atmosphere are detected in a tank filled with a liquid scintillator.
Measurements of mass and lifetime of muons will be realised.
A major component of the experiment is the set-up and adjustment of the analyzing equipment
and the conduction of various calibrations.
The results of the measurements will be used to calculate the coupling constant of the weak interaction.
