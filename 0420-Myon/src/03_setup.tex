        \caption{Experimental setup for the measurement of energy and decay time of cosmic muons.
        Muons are detected in a tank (filled with a scintillating fluid), causing flashes of light while flying through.
        The amount of light emitted is determined with photomultipliers,
        their signal then sent to a system of evaluating
        devices and recorded by multi-channel-analyzers.}
